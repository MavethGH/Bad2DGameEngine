## A bad 2D game engine
I work on this for fun. Blame Julie for asking me to share it.

### How to run this thing
Make sure you have SDL2 installed somewhere. I just used vcpkg. You should also copy SDL2.dll to the libs folder. After that, run CMake, build it, and pray to the machine gods.

#### Notes
It's called RhythmGame because originally I was going to make just that, and changing the folder name broke something that I can't be bothered to fix at the moment.

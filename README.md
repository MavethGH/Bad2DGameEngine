## A bad 2D game engine
I work on this for fun. Blame Julie for asking me to share it.

### How to run this thing
Make sure you have SDL2 installed somewhere. I just used vcpkg. You should also copy SDL2.dll to the libs folder. After that, run CMake, build it, and pray to the machine gods.

### Acknowledgements

This gentleman's channel is where I learned most of the OpenGL stuff:

The CMake scripts to find SDL2 are from here:

#### Notes
If it's called RhythmGame, that's because originally I was going to make just that, and changing the folder name broke something that I can't be bothered to fix at the moment.

Oh yeah, don't talk to me about the lack of a src folder. I'll get to that eventually.
